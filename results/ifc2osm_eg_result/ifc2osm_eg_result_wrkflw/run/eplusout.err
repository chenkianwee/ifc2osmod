   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** Site:GroundTemperature:BuildingSurface: Some values fall outside the range of 15-25C.
   **   ~~~   ** These values may be inappropriate.  Please consult the Input Output Reference for more details.
   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS ON CONTINUOUS", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** Calculated design heating load for zone=THERMAL ZONE 1 is zero.
   **   ~~~   ** Check Sizing:Zone and ZoneControl:Thermostat inputs.
   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = THERMAL ZONE 1PTAC 1SPD DX AC CLG COIL but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   ** Warning ** ZoneHVAC:PackagedTerminalAirConditioner "THERMAL ZONE 1 PTAC"
   **   ~~~   ** ...For fan type and name = Fan:OnOff "THERMAL ZONE 1PTAC_FAN"
   **   ~~~   ** ...Fan power ratio function of speed ratio curve has no impact if fan volumetric flow rate is the same as the unitary system volumetric flow rate.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Fan volumetric flow rate            = 0.15000 m3/s.
   **   ~~~   ** ...Unitary system volumetric flow rate = 0.15000 m3/s.

   ************* Beginning Simulation
   ** Warning ** Processing Monthly Tabular Reports: Variable names not valid for this simulation
   **   ~~~   ** ...use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings; to show more details on individual variables.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-ELECTRICITY" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-DISTILLATE OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-RESIDUAL OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-NATURAL GAS" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-COAL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
